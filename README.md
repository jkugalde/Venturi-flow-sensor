## Resume

Flow sensors are really expensive, so we used the Venturi principle to calculate the flow knowing the pressure drop between two different sections of a tube. It worked really well. The tube is 3d printed, the pressure is measured with a differential sensor and wired into an Arduino.

Now, some ideal fluid mechanics where the flow is laminar, there is no friction 

- As you should know, the mass of 

In the ideal world of physics, there is no friction so we can use the Bernoulli
